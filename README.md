# Apress Source Code

## Gitpod Workspace with Oracle Database 23c Free and F1data schema

This repo is a fork from the original source code repository prepared by Alex and Patrick. It has been extended with a Gitpod Workspace definition that includes an Oracle Database 23c Free instance that is setup with the F1data schema used by Alex and Patrick for the examples in their book. Once this workspace is running, you have access to a running database with the f1data schema including all tables and other database objects as well as the data.

For details on this ready-to-run database environment, read [this document](./README-gitpod-oracledatabase23c.md).
